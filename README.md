# python-templates
Boilerplate python files.

I had originally wrote these since I use them fairly often.

If you use a Linux system, clone the files in this repo to ~/Templates. If that directory does not exist, create it.
This allows you right click, and select 'New Document' and choose which template you want to load.

Hope it helps some people
